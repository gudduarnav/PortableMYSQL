2. There are 2 subfolders: *PortableMYSQL* and *README*.  
  
### Working with PortableMYSQL folder  
1. Python must be installed and the requirements must be satisfied.  
2. Double click on the `start.bat`. This will bring up a GUI.
3. Initialize the database by clicking on one of `Reset` button. I prefer `Reset Insecure` button, as it does not require any password for `root`.  
4. Start the server by clicking on `Start` button.  
5. Then the Server is ready for use. Configure the MYSQL client to connect on the `Host` IP and `Port` specified on the GUI.  
6. Stop the Server by clicking `Stop` button.
  
### Working with the ZIP Archive  
1. Download all the ZIP file from `ZIPArchive\*.zip` files.  
2. UnZIP the files to a folder.  
3. Open the folder and run the batch file `start.bat`.  
4. The server can directly be started without initialization. Its already initialized with the database. It also have Debug Information present in it.
